M2-Planet being based on the goal of bootstrapping the Minimal C compiler required to support structs, arrays, inline assembly and self hosting;
is rather small, under 1.7Kloc according to sloccount

* SETUP
The most obvious way to setup for M2-Planet development is to clone and setup mescc-tools first (https://github.com/oriansj/mescc-tools.git)
Then be sure to install any C compiler and make clone of your choice.

Should you wish to verify or leverage the M2-Moon bootstrap path;
please make sure to setup M2-Moon (https://github.com/oriansj/M2-Moon.git)
and then setup the knight-vm (https://github.com/oriansj/knight-vm.git)

* BUILD
The standard C based approach to building M2-Planet is simply running:
make M2-Planet

Should you wish to verify that M2-Planet was built correctly run:
make test

* ROADMAP
The current outstanding work for M2-Planet involves porting M2-Planet into M2-Moon and extending its functionality

* DEBUG
To get a properly debuggable binary:
make M2-Planet-gcc

* Bugs
M2-Planet assumes a very heavily restricted subset of the C language and many C
programs will break hard when passed to M2-Planet.

M2-Planet does not actually implement any primitive functionality, it is assumed
that will be written in inline assembly by the programmer or provided by the
programmer durring the assembly and linking stages
